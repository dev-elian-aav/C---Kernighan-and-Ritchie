# How would you test the word count program? What kind of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
* I would test with signals like \0 \b -> It thinks that wo\@rd is a word.
* I would test with numbers -> This uncovers a bug, the program sees numbers like 1000 and thinks it's a word. 
* I would test with spaces and tabs. -> Works fine.
