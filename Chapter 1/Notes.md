# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction
## 1.1 Getting Started

[QUESTIONS]
* How related are C and C++?
* How the C compiler, written in C, was compiled in the first place?
* Why the introduction separates OSes from "major programs"?
* What's the size of C variable types now?

[NOTES]
* C is a typed programming language.
* C is a low level language.
* C programs are comprised of functions and variables.
* Every program must have a "main" function somewhere.
* Functions are comprised of statements.
* The list of values provided to a function are called arguments.
* () besides a function means a empty list, the function expects no arguments.
* character string: sequence of characters inside double quotes.
* printf never supplies a newline character.
* escape sequence: general and extensible mechanism to write hard-to-type/invisible characters.
* All variables in C have to be declared before they are used.
* while: test condition -> condition is true -> execute statements inside the loop.
* while: test condition -> condition is false -> execute statements after the loop.
* Indentation and spacing are for better readability of the code.
* Integer division truncates in C. (Not special to C though)
